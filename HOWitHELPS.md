Imagine you want to preserve your grandmother’s apple pie recipe:

1. Use the **Editor** to load the skeleton and fill in details (ingredients, steps, notes).
2. Save it as `grandma-apple-pie.crd.xml`.
3. Switch to **Cardify** to generate a PDF card.
4. Share the `.crd.xml` with developers or archivists, and the `.crd.pdf` with family.

Now the recipe is both **machine‑readable** and **human‑friendly**, ensuring it lives on for generations.
