# inCOMPARISON — CRD App vs. Other Recipe Tools

The **CRD App** was built to solve problems that other recipe apps and platforms only partially address.  
This document compares CRD App to other tools with similar goals and explains why CRD App beats them all.

## 🍳 Traditional Recipe Websites
- **Limitations**
  - Recipes are written in free text, often inconsistent.
  - Ads, pop‑ups, and clutter distract from the cooking experience.
  - Metadata (nutrition, timing, storage) is incomplete or buried in prose.
- **CRD App Advantage**
  - Recipes are stored in **structured XML (CRD)**, ensuring consistency.
  - No ads, no backend — everything runs client‑side in your browser.
  - Metadata is explicit and machine‑readable, making recipes portable and reusable.

## 📄 PDF Recipe Collections
- **Limitations**
  - Static documents — hard to edit, parse, or integrate into apps.
  - No schema enforcement, leading to ambiguity.
  - Sharing requires manual updates and re‑exports.
- **CRD App Advantage**
  - Recipes authored in CRD XML can be **edited, parsed, and transformed**.
  - Built‑in **Cardify** feature generates PDFs on demand.
  - Recipes remain dynamic: XML for developers, PDF for cooks.

## 📱 Mobile Cooking Apps
- **Limitations**
  - Proprietary formats lock recipes inside the app.
  - Often require accounts, subscriptions,and other non-needed stuff.
  - Limited ability to export recipes in structured formats.

## 🧑‍💻 Developer‑Focused Recipe APIs
- **Limitations**
  - Focused on machine consumption, not human readability.
  - Require backend integration and API keys.
  - Often lack cultural, sensory, or historical context.

  - Includes sensory cues, cultural symbolism, and author notes.
  - No backend required — parse directly in the browser.

## 📚 Cookbook Software
- **Limitations**
  - Heavy desktop applications with steep learning curves.
  - Recipes stored in proprietary formats.
  - Sharing requires exporting to PDFs or images.
