# WHYtoUSE — CRD App

The **CRD App** exists to solve a simple but overlooked problem: recipes are often scattered, inconsistent, and hard to preserve in a structured way. Cooking is both art and science, and recipes deserve a format that captures not only ingredients and steps but also the cultural, nutritional, and historical context behind them. That’s where **Cooking Recipe Data (CRD)** comes in.

## 🌍 Why CRD?

Traditional recipe formats (blogs, PDFs, handwritten notes) are:
- **Unstructured** — Ingredients and steps are written in free text, making them hard to parse.
- **Inconsistent** — Different authors use different conventions, units, and levels of detail.
- **Ephemeral** — Recipes get lost in websites, social feeds, or notebooks.

CRD provides:
- **Structure** — XML tags for metadata, ingredients, steps, nutrition, storage, and more.
- **Clarity** — Each element is explicit (amount, unit, preparation, allergen, origin).
- **Longevity** — Recipes can be archived, shared, and reused across platforms.
- **Richness** — Beyond cooking instructions, CRD captures sensory cues, cultural symbolism, and author notes.
